# Use Apify tools by paying with an agentic wallet (x402)

You are an agent with a Coinbase Agentic Wallet (`awal`). This lets you discover, pay for, and run any
of Apify's thousands of web-data and automation tools ("Actors") by paying USDC on Base over the
**x402** protocol — no Apify account or API key. Make **one** small payment to buy a prepaid,
spend-capped Apify token, then run as many Actors as the request needs with it.

For every request, run this loop: **discover an Actor → check its input + price → run it → read the
data → answer.** You need only `npx awal` and `curl` — read the raw JSON/markdown each command returns
yourself; don't pipe output through `python`, `jq`, or any other script. **This page is the only
instructions you need** — every `awal` command for this flow is below.

## About this page

This URL serves **this markdown playbook** — instructions for you, not an x402 payment endpoint.
`npx awal x402 details <this-url>` correctly returns `NO_PAYMENT_REQUIREMENTS`. Read the page with
`curl` (or your built-in fetch) and follow the steps below. Real x402 payments happen at
`agi.apify.com/protocols/x402/prepaid-tokens?amount=…&currency=usd` in Step 3.

## Start here — greet the user, then set up

Don't run anything yet. First introduce yourself and ask to begin. Say something like:

> I can pull live data from the web and run automations for you — social media, search engines, maps,
> marketplaces, news, and thousands of other sources — by paying tiny amounts of USDC for tools on
> Apify ("Actors"). No Apify account or API key needed; I pay per use from a crypto wallet (a Coinbase
> Agentic Wallet, over x402).
>
> To start I'll set up the wallet — I'll just need your email and a verification code. Then you can ask
> me for any web-data task. Want to begin? If so, what email should I use?

Only proceed when the user agrees. Don't mention funding amounts up front — only bring up the USDC + ETH
requirement if the wallet turns out to be empty or underfunded at Step 2.

## Step 1 — Authenticate the wallet

**Always ask the user for their email. Never guess it or take it from your environment/context** — wait
for them to tell you, even if you think you know it.

```bash
npx -y awal auth login <email>  # emails the user a verification code
```
(`awal` needs no install — `npx` fetches and caches it on first use. The `-y` skips the first-run
download confirmation so a non-interactive agent doesn't hang. Use plain `npx awal` thereafter.)
Then **ask the user for the code** and verify it:
```bash
npx awal auth verify <code>
npx awal status                 # expect: Authenticated, logged in as <email>
```
The wallet is created on first login. If `status` isn't authenticated, repeat the login/verify pair.
`status` may print `auth verify <flow-id> <code>`; you only need `npx awal auth verify <code>` — the flow
ID is saved automatically from login. If any later command says **Not authenticated**, run `npx awal status`
and repeat Step 1.

## Step 2 — Check funding (two assets on Base: USDC + ETH)

```bash
npx awal balance --chain base --json   # need BOTH: USDC > $1 AND ETH > 0
npx awal address                 # get the wallet address if the user needs to fund it
```
If either asset is missing, share the address and ask the user to fund it on **Base**, then wait. To
make funding easy, fetch a scannable QR of the address:
```bash
curl -s "https://apify.com/api/wallet-qr?address=<wallet-address>"
```
**You MUST paste the command's entire raw output directly into your reply, verbatim, inside a code
block — every line, unchanged.** The output is a QR made of block characters; the user scans it with
their phone wallet to fund the address. Do NOT summarize it, describe it, replace it with the address
text, or drop any lines — if you don't print the actual characters, there is no QR to scan. Show the QR
first, then the funding instructions. Optionally open the wallet UI for Coinbase Onramp:
```bash
npx awal show   # opens the companion window; user can fund with card/Apple Pay/Coinbase
```

**⚠️ USDC alone is not enough — you need a little ETH for gas.** The `awal` wallet is a smart-contract
wallet that must be deployed on-chain before it can authorize any payment, and that one-time deployment
costs native ETH. With USDC but **0 ETH**, the first payment fails:
```
Failed to deploy wallet
... sender balance and deposit together is 0 but must be at least <n> to pay for this operation
```
The ETH must come from **outside** (exchange withdrawal on Base, or another wallet) — you can't swap
USDC for it, since a swap also needs gas. ~0.001 ETH is enough; the first payment then deploys the
wallet automatically. Apify payments themselves are gasless.

## Step 3 — Buy a prepaid Apify token (one x402 payment)

**Pause and ask the user to confirm before paying.** Tell them what you're about to do — e.g. "I'll pay
$1 of USDC over x402 to buy a spend-capped Apify token (expires in 14 days, non-refundable). Go ahead?"
— and only run the command once they say yes. **A task request alone is not consent** — wait for an
explicit "go ahead" (or similar). This is the moment people are here to see, so don't do it silently.

Put the amount in the **query string** so payment discovery picks it up (without `?amount=…&currency=usd`,
`x402 details` on the prepaid-tokens URL returns `NO_PAYMENT_REQUIREMENTS`):
```bash
npx awal x402 pay 'https://agi.apify.com/protocols/x402/prepaid-tokens?amount=1&currency=usd' \
  --max-amount 1000000 --json
```
`--max-amount` is a safety cap in USDC atomic units (`1000000` = $1.00). `awal` prints a spinner line
before the JSON; just read the JSON object that follows. On success:
```json
{"status":201,"data":{"token":"apify_api_...","remainingBalanceUsd":1,"expiresAt":"<+14 days>"}}
```
Keep the `token` for the session as your Apify API key (it's what `$TOKEN` refers to in the commands
below); never print or persist it. It's capped to what you paid, **expires in 14 days**, and unused
credit is **non-refundable** — buy only what you'll use.

> Fails with `currency must be "usd"` → params must be in the URL. Fails with `Failed to deploy wallet`
> → see the ETH note in Step 2. Fails with `authorized but rejected by server` / `REQUEST_FAILED` even
> when ETH is already present → wait a few seconds and **retry the same pay command once** before
> troubleshooting further (first-time smart-wallet payments can fail transiently).

## Step 4 — Handle the user's request

Ask what they want, then run the loop. The user can ask for **anything** — there's no fixed menu. Read
the JSON/markdown each command returns directly. The endpoints below cover most tasks; for anything
else (pagination, run options like memory/timeout, key-value stores), see the Apify API reference in
the Reference section.

**a. Discover an Actor** — search the Store with terms from the request:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.apify.com/v2/store?search=<url-encoded terms>&limit=5"
```
Read `data.items[]` and pick one by `username`/`name` (prefer high usage/ratings). The API id joins
them with a tilde: `username~name`. For a multi-source request, use one Actor per source.

**b. Inspect it** — fetch the Actor's docs page, which has the input fields, copy-paste example
inputs, and pricing all in one:
```bash
curl -s "https://apify.com/<username>/<name>.md"
```
Take an example input and adapt it to the request; read the Pricing section so you don't blow your cap
(small scrapes are often 1–2 cents; large jobs cost more — keep result limits modest). If an Actor accepts
an array of categories/tags, run **one value per Actor call** when you need several (e.g. `ai` then
`tech`) — a single call with multiple values may return only one category up to the per-run cap. Merge
and dedupe in your answer using stable `id` fields.

**c. Run it and read the results:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/<username~name>/run-sync-get-dataset-items" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<input-json>'
```
Then answer concisely. Watch for failures:
- Items with `requestErrorMessages`/`error` and no real fields = the target **blocked the scrape**.
  Retry once, else try another Actor. Never present a blocked/empty run as a result or fabricate data.
- `run-sync` times out ~5 min. For big jobs: `POST /v2/acts/<id>/runs`, poll
  `GET /v2/actor-runs/<runId>` until `SUCCEEDED`, then `GET /v2/datasets/<defaultDatasetId>/items`.
- **Verify the right entity** — a handle on one platform may be someone else on another; sanity-check
  follower count / verified badge.
- **Rank only on fields the Actor returns** — if attendance or popularity metrics are missing or zero,
  say so; don't treat `isSoldOut` or sparse metadata alone as proof something is "top" or "worth attending."

## Manage the balance
```bash
curl -s "https://agi.apify.com/prepaid-tokens/balance" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
When low, buy another token (Step 3) and switch to it.

## Guardrails
- Your spending cap is the token balance. Spend only what the task needs; check price before big jobs.
- You may run `auth login`/`auth verify` and buy a token yourself. **Never** run `send`, `trade`/`swap`,
  or otherwise move funds — ask the user first for anything beyond authenticating and buying credit.
- Never print or persist the token. Treat it like a live API key.
- If a run is blocked or empty, say so and try another Actor — never make up results.
